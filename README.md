## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Rust programming language installed on your system. [Get Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Peggun/nget.git
   cd nget
   ```
2. Build the project:

   ```
3. Run the tool:
   ```bash
   cargo run -- -u [URL] -o [SAVE_DIR]
   ```

## Usage
To download a file, run the following command:
```bash
cargo run -- -u https://example.com/file.zip -o ./downloads/
```
- Replace `https://example.com/file.zip` with the URL of the file you want to download.
- Replace `./downloads/` with the directory where you want to save the file.
